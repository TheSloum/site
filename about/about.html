            Hello there, thank you for coming here.
            I would say I'm more of a developper, and an artist/illustrator, though I find my interests pretty much anywhere. Music, storytelling, design...
            I'm currently a student in MMI (Multimedia and Internet), looking for ways to improve on my own, I like to learn things from scratch, and building things. Like this site.
